A virtual machine is a software implementation of a physical machine.  In this post, we'll be building one up from scratch.  
Intended Audience
Anyone with a basic understanding of C++.

Our virtual machine.
There are lots of machines out in the wild.  x86, RISC etc... each with their own pros and cons factoring into computer designers decisions.  The machine we'll be making is solely for educational purposes.  It'll be basic, but it'll still be able to compute anything that any other computer is capable of (Turing machine).  

Only a single instruction is actually required to make a turing complete cpu.

In the real world, creating a machine is a complex task.
