As you've probably already read, Ethereum has a 'turing complete programming language'.  

What does this mean? 

In the context of a programming language, it means that the language needs to be able to do everything that a Turing Machine can do. So...What is a Turing machine?  A turing machine can be thought of as an infinitely long tape of cells, with a read/write head which can be moved along this tape and read and write to any of the cells.  Like memory in a personal computer, except infinite.  With this property, anything that's computable can be computed.

Using these basic properties, anything computable can be computed.
